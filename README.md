# mykit-learn  

**mykit-learn** is a custom implementation of popular machine learning algorithms built from scratch. Inspired by scikit-learn, this library aims to provide a hands-on understanding of fundamental ML concepts and algorithms.  

## Implemented Algorithms  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Decision Trees**  

## Purpose  
This project is a personal exploration of machine learning, emphasizing the implementation and functionality of algorithms without reliance on external libraries.  

## Getting Started  
This repository is under development, and additional instructions will be added as the implementation progresses.  

## Contributions  
Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome! Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
